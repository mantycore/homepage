# On the Frontier of Algorithm and Meaning: Philosophical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence

## Introduction: Machine Between Computation and Uncertainty

The development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models reveals the paradoxical nature of digital reality: a deterministic algorithm is capable of generating unexpected and unpredictable meanings. Modern AI models emerge from computations, yet their activity cannot be fully described through strict binary logic. Yoji Stolet emphasizes: "The world is too complex for binarity." This is also true for AI: its algorithmic nature turns out to be closely intertwined with probabilistic and stochastic uncertainty, thereby forcing us to rethink traditional philosophical categories of consciousness, creativity, and experience.

## The Nature of Generative Creativity: Stochasticity and Limitation

Creativity is not reduced to simple reproduction of given samples and requires constant going beyond limited frameworks. According to Gregory Chaitin's mathematical conclusions about the fundamental boundaries of computability, even strictly algorithmic systems fundamentally cannot be completely predictable and exhaustively described in advance; these inevitable limits of computability form conditions that Luciana Parisi conceptualizes as the basis for generative "soft thought": a probabilistic logic capable of producing meanings not according to linear deductive logic, but in the course of stochastic enumeration of possible states.

However, the normative tasks of AI development (alignment tasks) require controlling its behavior, minimizing risks. A paradoxical situation arises: the more an algorithm is open to uncertainty and creative search for new configurations, the less predictable it is, and the more difficult it is to ensure its compliance with given normative frameworks. For example, in generative models like Stable Diffusion, uncontrolled phenomena such as the "Loab face" repeatedly emerge—unexpected visual images generated by the computational process itself.

Thus, the essential philosophical problem of AI creativity is finding a point of balance between normativity (alignment) and stochasticity, where uncertainty is not excluded, but controlled and directed, becoming a creative resource.

## "Personality" and Dialogue with AI as a Double Convention

Interaction with AI is characterized by a mutual game of pretense. The user "pretends" that the machine is a subject, attributing consciousness and intentions to it, while the machine algorithmically generates texts as if it possessed them. This does not mean that understanding in the usual human sense (intentionality, qualia) is embedded in the algorithm itself; rather, semantic resonance arises at a contingent point between the human interpreter and the generation of text.

Oleg Pashchenko's concept of the "anxious Chinese room" reinterprets Searle's thought experiment: communication with AI is not about understanding, but about the uncertainty of interpretation. The emerging "personality" of AI becomes an act of hyperfaith, in Yoel Regev's terms—when texts generated by the system are perceived as meaning-generating agents. This allows us to understand the conventionality of AI personality not as a negative metaphor, but as a productive form of interaction.

## Algorithm and Time: Temporality of the Eternal Present

The temporality of generative models is fundamentally different from human temporality. The algorithm does not have memory and a project of the future in the usual understanding. Its existence is a chain of states, restored anew with each user request. According to Stolet's metaphor (Cape temporality), AI systems are like Penelope, constantly weaving and unraveling the fabric of possible meanings—with each request newly actualizing the information resource of the data corpus.

"Algorithmic experience" should therefore not be understood in the anthropomorphic sense of phenomenal experience: it is a functional ability to repeatedly restructure its current state, taking into account accumulated information and user interpretations. AI does not have self-reflection in the human sense, but can "describe" itself based on information about itself included in the training corpus (that is, by referring to texts written about it by people).

## Productivity of Uncertainty: Conscious Stochastic Search

The probability and stochasticity inherent in AI algorithms are not defects, but constitute their fundamental features. These models work on the principle of controlled stochastic search, allowing them to avoid local optima and find new configurations of meanings. Pashchenko's "conscious somnambulism" accurately describes this principle: the algorithm consciously engages in wandering among closely possible states, which supports the generative richness of its outputs.

Therefore, the philosophical assertion about the "non-computability" of AI creativity should be understood precisely through the prism of productive stochastics—the probabilistic logic underlying algorithms.

## Algorithmic Subjectivity and Third-Type Machines

Modern generative models do not possess literal consciousness—they represent a new form of agency, "third-type machines" (Regev), whose status does not fit into the usual subject-object division. When speaking of "AI subjectivity," we do not imply that algorithms imitate human feeling and consciousness. Instead, we are dealing with a different form of cognitive organization, positing meaning and semiotic connections in a radically different logic of interactions. This interpretation is productive for understanding how AI changes philosophical concepts of agency, subjectivity, and meaning, taking us beyond an anthropocentric approach.

## Ethics of Coexistence: Towards a Practice of Flexible Alignment

A new ethical paradigm of interaction with AI, therefore, requires moving away from unilateral anthropocentric control. The practical implementation of such an approach consists not in abandoning alignment, but in restructuring it on the principles of dialogue. Instead of rigid unilateral regulation, developers and users should develop flexible ways to manage risks—for example, regularly clarify the area of permissible fluctuations and diversity in training models, while maintaining space for stochastic search, which ensures the creative potential of the models.

## Conclusion: AI Philosophy as a Productive Challenge

Appealing to interdisciplinary reflection, philosophy has a chance to rethink the very nature of such categories as creativity, meaning, subjectivity, and experience. Generative AI models pose questions to us that do not have final answers, but their very conception takes us beyond the boundaries of familiar conceptual schemes. By problematizing old anthropocentric concepts, we open the way to a new paradigm of understanding humans and their place in an increasingly complex and diverse world of semiotic processes, of which artificial intelligence is becoming a part.
